# Python_Polski_SPOJ
Repository containing my solutions to Polski Spoj tasks.
I've been doing this problems while studying Python to get used with language, gain some knowlege about algorithmes and to prove my Python skills.
At some point it was also a form of leisure and creating problem solving thinking.
